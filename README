Flickr Widget displays up to 10 of the latest photos from your Flickr stream.
This widget is based on Donncha O Caoimh's Flickr widget plugin from
http://donncha.wordpress.com/flickr-widget/

Specifically, this has been modified to use the newer SimplePie RSS functions,
images are now in divs instead of a table, misc escaping function updates, and
the inclusion of the jQuery lightbox plugin.
